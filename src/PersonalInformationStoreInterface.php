/**
 * Represents a Storage that can be used to contain all Personally Identifiable Information
 * that the application tracks. To provide an easy way to maintain and get rid of it when required.
 * The use of this storage should be an explicit dependency in all {@link DomainMessageHandler} and `Domain Services`,
 * when Personally identifiable information is stored as orkestra-privacy Data Compliance should be an explicit business requirement.
 *
 * This storage interface works with some core concepts:
 * - Personal Data represents a PII value such as a person's name, email address, phone number, birthdate etc.
 * - Personal Token - represents a token that is used internally by the application to identify a given person. Such as an internal UUID, in other words the owner of Personal Data.
 *   For GDPR compliance this value should not be natural key and easily disposable, i.e. it should not be used to identify the natural person after an erasure of their data.
 * - A Reference Token - Represents a reference to some given Personal Data that can be used in the application to reference the data contained there.
 *
 * Implementations of this store should take the necessary precautions to encrypt the data.
